# Student result analysis
This repository contains Python code for analysing and visualising a dataset of student performance. The dataset includes various features such as gender, parental education, and study habits, which are used to identify patterns and relationships in academic scores across maths, reading, and writing.

# Introduction

The aim of this project is to:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on student performance data.
Investigate relationships between demographic and behavioural factors and academic scores.
Use visualisations such as heatmaps, box plots, and pie charts to present findings effectively.
The code includes steps for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualisation using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains student-related information and their scores in maths, reading, and writing.

# Features and Analysis
1. Data Cleaning and Manipulation
- Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., Unnamed: 0).
- Identified and addressed missing values.
  
2. Gender Distribution
- Visualised the distribution of students based on gender.
  
3. Parent Education vs Student Scores
- Analysed the impact of parental education levels on student performance using a heatmap.
  
4. Parent Marital Status vs Student Scores
- Explored the relationship between parental marital status and student scores.
  
5. Distribution of Ethnic Groups
- Presented the ethnic group distribution using a pie chart.
  
6. Box Plots for Score Distribution
- Created box plots to visualise the spread of scores in maths, reading, and writing.

# Visualisations
1. Gender Distribution
A count plot was created to show the number of male and female students.

2. Parent Education and Scores
A heatmap displays the average scores in maths, reading, and writing based on parental education levels.

3. Ethnic Group Distribution
A pie chart illustrates the proportion of students in each ethnic group (A, B, C, D, E).

4. Box Plots
Box plots reveal the distribution and potential outliers for scores in maths, reading, and writing.
